# Contributions

The project is divided into 3 main blocks: Data Preparation, RAG System Implementation, and Results Evaluations. 
During the entire project, our teammates have been extremely collaborative. 
Teammate dedicated to a section is responsible for both the codes and the writeup. 

The generic division of labor is as follows (in alphabetical order):

Yue Wu: 1) Implemented a RAG system that combines a sparse, a dense, and two hybrid retriever components with a question-answering LLM reader. 2) Wrote the jupyter-notebook equivalence for command-line 3) Preliminary testing on a truncated test set

Pei Xue: 1) Collected, scraped and chunked text data; 2) Tested the RAG system on both test and unseen datasets; 3) Designed and implemented evaluation metrics.

Yuanchun Ye: 1) Collected, scraped and chunked text data; 2) Tested the RAG system on both test and unseen datasets; 3) Designed and implemented evaluation metrics.
